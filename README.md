Project Overview
Product demand prediction is a crucial task for businesses to optimize their inventory, production, and supply chain management. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the demand for various products based on historical data and relevant features.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

Collect and preprocess historical sales and product data.
Develop a machine learning model to predict product demand.
Train and evaluate the model's performance.
Deploy the model for real-time demand prediction.
Requirements
To use and contribute to this project, you'll need the following software and libraries:

Python 3.6+
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for data exploration)
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
XGBoost (or any other machine learning library of your choice)
Flask (for deployment)
Docker (optional, for containerization)
Data Collection
Collecting historical sales and product data is a critical step in this project. You may need to source data from various internal or external sources. The dataset should include relevant information, such as product attributes, sales history, and external factors that might influence demand.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the quality and suitability of your data for machine learning. Some common data preprocessing steps include:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Feature selection
Refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook or data preprocessing script for detailed instructions on how to clean and prepare your data.

Machine Learning Model
You can choose from various machine learning algorithms for demand prediction, such as regression, time series analysis, or tree-based methods like XGBoost. The choice of algorithm depends on the characteristics of your data and problem.

Training
Train your machine learning model on the preprocessed data. Tune hyperparameters and use cross-validation to ensure your model's robustness. Save the trained model for future use.

Evaluation
Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The model's accuracy and robustness should be thoroughly assessed.

Deployment
To deploy the model for real-time demand prediction, consider using a web framework like Flask. You can create an API that takes product and context information as input and returns demand predictions as output.

Usage
Once the model is deployed, users can interact with it through API endpoints. You may also create a web-based interface for easy access. Make sure to provide clear documentation on how to use the deployed model.
